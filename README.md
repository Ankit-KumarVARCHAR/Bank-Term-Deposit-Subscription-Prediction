Term Deposit Subscription Prediction Project
Congratulations on completing the course! For your final project, you'll be tackling a real-life business problem faced by a retail banking institution.

Problem Statement:
The bank heavily relies on term deposits as a major source of income. Term deposits are cash investments held at the bank for an agreed rate of interest over a fixed term. To increase term deposit subscriptions, the bank employs various outreach strategies, including telephonic marketing campaigns. However, these campaigns require significant investment in call centers. Therefore, it's crucial to identify customers most likely to subscribe to term deposits beforehand to target them efficiently.

Dataset Description:
You'll be provided with client data such as age, job type, marital status, etc., along with information on the telephonic marketing calls, including call duration, day, and month of the call.

Project Objective:
Your task is to build a classification model that predicts whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on the provided data. By accurately identifying potential subscribers, the bank can optimize its telephonic marketing campaigns, reducing costs and improving conversion rates.

Topics Covered:
Throughout this project, you'll apply various concepts learned in the course, including:

Data preprocessing and cleaning
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Feature engineering
Model selection and evaluation
Hyperparameter tuning
Interpretation of model results
Deliverables:
Your final deliverable will include:

Jupyter Notebook containing the entire project workflow, from data exploration to model evaluation.
Model deployment (optional).
Documentation explaining the methodology, insights gained, and recommendations for the bank.
Feel free to explore additional techniques or strategies beyond what's covered in the course to enhance the predictive performance of your model.

Let's dive into this exciting project and help the bank maximize its term deposit subscriptions through data-driven insights!
